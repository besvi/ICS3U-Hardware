        <h2>Graphic Tablet</h2>
        
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        A <strong><em>graphic tablet</em></strong> is a device used to allow drawing or tracing via a stylus or pen rather than with a mouse<br>
    Unlike with a traditional mouse, the use of a stylus and tablet allow for precision tracking relative to the stylus' 
    position in space relative to the trackpad. A mouse bases the cursor's position by the physical movement, regardless 
    of where the mouse is in space.
