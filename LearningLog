**Things I learnt
  Among the things I learnt during this project, some of the most important in my mind are how to create a webpage with html and make it 
look good/somewhat acceptable aesthetically, or more accurately, how to simply alter the look of my webpage through the use of CSS. Other
things I learnt were the importance of saving your work to the appropriate destination, as well as how coding is quite difficult, though
not as difficult as I originially expected it to be-- which was rocket science level.

**Things I still want to learn
  I want to learn how to do more with CSS to improve the look of a webpage, specifically being effects and design elements.
I also want to learn about how to use variables in my code for a more interactive platform
